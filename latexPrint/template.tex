Mientras mas pasan los anos me contradigo cuando pienso 
{\bf Dm                     G}
El tiempo no me mueve yo me muevo con el tiempo 

Soy las ganas de vivir 
las ganas de cruzar 
las ganas de conocer lo que hay despues del mar 
yo espero que mi boca nunca se calle 
tambien espero que las turbinas de este avion nunca me fallen 
no tengo todo calculado ni mi vida resuelta 
solo tengo una sonrisa y espero una de vuelta
yo confio en el destino y en la marejada 
yo no creo en la iglesia pero creo en tu mirada 
tu eres el sol en mi cara cuando me levanta 
yo soy la vida que ya tengo tu eres la vida que me falta 
asi que agarra tu maleta el bulto los motetes 
el equipaje tu valija la mochila con todos tus juguetes y 

{\bf B....                   A7....            Dm....}

darle al vuelta al mundo 

la renta el sueldo el trabajo en la oficina 
lo cambie por las estrellas y por huertos de harina 
me escape de la rutina para pilotear mi viaje 
por que el cubo en el que vivia se convirtio en paisaje 
yo era un objeto esperando a ser ceniza 
un dia decidi hacerle caso a la brisa 
a irme resbalando detras de tu camisa 
no me convencio nadie me convencio tu sonrisa 
y me fui tras de ti persiguiendo mi instinto 
si quieres cambio verdadero pues camina distinto 
voy a escaparme hasta la constelacion mas cercana la suerte es mi oxigeno tus ojos son mi ventana 
quiero correr por 7 lagos en un mismo dia 
sentir encima de mis muslos el clima de tus nalgas frias 
llegar al tope de la sierra abrazarme con las nubes 
sumergirme bajo el agua y ver como las burbujas suben y

dame la mano y vamos a darle la vuelta al mundo darle la vuelta al mundo darle al vuelta al mundo 
dame la mano y vamos a darle la vuelta al mundo darle la vuelta al mundo darle al vuelta al mundo

{\bf            Verse 1:}
{\bf Em                        G}
This is a song that came upon me one night 
{\bf           Am}
When the news it had been telling me 
{\bf        C                D}
About one more war and one more fight
{\bf       Em }
And 'aeh' I sighed but then
{\bf      G}
I thought about my friends
{\bf          Am}
Then I wrote this declaration
{\bf          C              D}
Just in case the world end
{\bf  }


{\bf            Verse 2:}
Our guns
{\bf Em             G}
 We shot them in the things we said
{\bf         Am}
Ah we didn't need no bullets 
{\bf          C            D}
Cos we rely on some words instead 
{\bf Em}
Kill someone in argument
{\bf G}
Outwit them with our brains 
{\bf           Am}
And we'd kill ourselves laughing
{\bf          C                D}
At the funny things we'd say 



{\bf            Verse 3:}
And bombs 
{\bf Em              G}
  We had them saved for special times
{\bf           Am}
When the crew would call a shakedown 
{\bf      C            D}
We break down a party landmine 
{\bf Em}
Women that so sexy 
{\bf         G}
They explode us with their looks 
{\bf          Am}
Ah we blowing up some speakers 
{\bf           C              D        }
Jumping round till the ground shook 



{\bf            Verse 4:}
And missiles
{\bf Em                   G}
   They were the roadtrips that we launched
{\bf        Am}
T-t-tripping across this island 
{\bf             C              D}
Starting missions at the break of dawn
{\bf  Em}
Yawn and smile say 
{\bf         G}
What direction shall we take? 
{\bf Am}
Somewhere where it warm and wet 
{\bf C                        D}
This be the route we'd always take and 



{\bf            Chorus:}
{\bf Am                      Em}
  Our weapons were our instruments 
{\bf G           D          C}
Made from timber and steel 
{\bf               Am}
We never yielded to conformity 
{\bf       Em}
But stood like kings 
{\bf         G}
In a chariot that's riding on a 
{\bf    D}
Record wheel 

{\bf             Verse 5:}
{\bf            Em}
And our airforce flying 
{\bf             G}
When the frisbee in the sky 
{\bf          Am}
Have a session while we're smoking
{\bf              C           D}
Now we're feeling extra high 
{\bf           Em }
And we'd sneak into a carpark
{\bf             G}
With the skaties on our back 
{\bf             Am}
And we're flying down the levels howling 
{\bf          C                D}
On the attack now on the attack



{\bf            Verse 6:}
And battles 
{\bf Em                   G}
  They happened in these dancehalls 
{\bf            Am}
See we'd rather fight with music
{\bf     C               D}
Choosing one the rhythm war
{\bf Em}
Battle at these shakedowns 
{\bf          G}
And we battle at these gigs 
{\bf         Am}
We do battle in our bedrooms 
{\bf             C                D}
Made some sweet love to the beat 



           Bridge:
{\bf            Em}
Then our allies grew 
{\bf      G}
Wherever we would roam 
{\bf         Am }
See whenever we're together 
{\bf         C             D}
Any stranger feel at home 
{\bf       Em}
In a way we are an army 
{\bf           G}
But this army not destruct 
{\bf       Am}
No instead we're doing simple things
{\bf        C             D}
Good loving find it run amuck 



{\bf            Verse 7:}
{\bf Em}
This be a declaration 
{\bf    G}
Written about my friends
{\bf         Am}
It's engraved into this song 
{\bf          C               D}
So they know I'm not forgetting them 
{\bf       Em}
See maybe if the world contained
{\bf  G}
More people like these 
{\bf           Am}
Then the news would not be telling me
{\bf        C                   D}
About all that warfare endlessly and

{\bf VERSE 1: }
{\bf     Dm                                        Bb }
Oh, I had nine lives but I lost all of them

And I've been searching in the night  
{\bf                          Am7 (and so on)...       }
And I've been searching in the rain 
I tried to find them, but they disappeared 
They walked away, they dressed in black 
They left my side and all I say is 
That I wasted time when I looked for them 
For now I know that things gone past  
Are never to be found again 
No never, never again 
I had nine lives but lost all of them... 
{\bf  }
{\bf VERSE 2: }
I had a plan but never finished it 
And I've been searching for the thought 
And I've been searching in a haze  
I try all days, to remember it 
But now the blueprint in my mind has gone 
My mind forgot the colour of direction 
And my eyes they see the hands 
That could've built that could've constructed 
The empire in my mind 
The empire I'll never find 
I had a plan but that was where it ended....ended.....

In summer the bushfires rage and rage
And rage
On such beautiful days
And we fight them with water that runs through the cracks
Water we're desperately trying to save
So I'll just live on wine and water my vines
And sleep on the wind with the fires right behind
And sing on the beaches and dance through the night
Oh we'll cry 'pass the wine, pass the wine, pass the wine'

{\bf      D                 D         Em        G     D/A G/C /C D/}
	Walking with your wild best friend


And my conductress on the number nineteen, she was a honey
pink toenails and hands all dirty with the money
greasy greasy greasy hair, easy smile
made me feel nineteen, for awhile
and I went down to Chinatown
in the backroom it's a man's world, all the money go down
Duck inside the doorway, gotta duck to eat
right now feels all right now, you and me we can't beat walking -

{\bf Chorus}

And a gogo, dancing girl, yes I saw her
the deejay, he say, here's Mandy for ya
I fell all right to see her, but she's paid to do that stuff
She's dancing high, I move on by, the close ups can get rough
when you're walking in the wild west end . . .

\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
{\bf Intro:}

{\bf / G - - - / - - - - / C - - - / - - - - / x4}

{\bf G (2)}
I lit out from Reno,
{\bf             C (2)}
I was trailed by twenty hounds
{\bf  G (2)}
Didn't get to sleep that night
{\bf                C (2)}
'Till the morning came around.

{\bf Chorus:}
{\bf   D (2)}
Set out runnin' but I take my time
{\bf      Am (2)}
A friend of the devil is a friend of mine
{\bf    D (2)}
If I get home before daylight,
{\bf    Am (2)                                 D (4)}
I just might get some sleep tonight.

Ran into the devil, babe,
He loaned me twenty billf
I spent the night in Utah
In a cave up in the hills.

{\bf Chorus}

I ran down to the levee
But the devil caught me there
He took my twenty-dollar bill
And vanished in the air.

{\bf Chorus}

{\bf Bridge:}
{\bf   D (2)}
Got two reasons why I cry
{\bf     D (2)}
Away each lonely night,
{\bf        C (2)}
The first one's named Sweet Anne Marie,
{\bf           C (2)                        }
And she's my hearts delight.
{\bf         D (2)}
The second one is prison, baby,
{\bf           D (2)}
{\bf The sheriff's on my trail,}
{\bf       Am (2)}
And if he catches up with me,
{\bf         C                    D (4)}
I'll spend my life in jail.

Got a wife in Chino, babe,
And one in Cherokee
The first one says she's got my child,
But it don't look like me.

{\bf Chorus}

{\bf 	  Am                G                F           G }
There must be some kind of way out of here
Said the joker to the thief
There's too much confusion
I can't get no relief
Buisness men they drink my wine
Plowmen dig my earth
None would ever compromise
Nobody of this world

No reason to get excited
The thief he kindly spoke
There are many here among us
Who feel that life is but a joke
But you and I we've been through that
And this is not our place
So let us stop talking falsely now
The hour's getting late

All along the watchtower
Princess kept the view
While all the women came and went
Barefoot servants too
Outside in the cold distance
A wildcat did growl
Two riders were approaching
And the wind began to howl

All along the watchtower
All along the watchtower
All along the watchtower

And the clowns have all gone to bed

You can hear happiness staggering on down the street

Footsteps dressed in red
