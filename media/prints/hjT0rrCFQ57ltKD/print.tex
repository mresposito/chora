Soy las ganas de vivir 
las ganas de cruzar 
las ganas de conocer lo que hay despues del mar 
yo espero que mi boca nunca se calle 
tambien espero que las turbinas de este avion nunca me fallen 
no tengo todo calculado ni mi vida resuelta 
solo tengo una sonrisa y espero una de vuelta
yo confio en el destino y en la marejada 
yo no creo en la iglesia pero creo en tu mirada 
tu eres el sol en mi cara cuando me levanta 
yo soy la vida que ya tengo tu eres la vida que me falta 
asi que agarra tu maleta el bulto los motetes 
el equipaje tu valija la mochila con todos tus juguetes y 

{\bf B....                   A7....            Dm....}

la renta el sueldo el trabajo en la oficina 
lo cambie por las estrellas y por huertos de harina 
me escape de la rutina para pilotear mi viaje 
por que el cubo en el que vivia se convirtio en paisaje 
yo era un objeto esperando a ser ceniza 
un dia decidi hacerle caso a la brisa 
a irme resbalando detras de tu camisa 
no me convencio nadie me convencio tu sonrisa 
y me fui tras de ti persiguiendo mi instinto 
si quieres cambio verdadero pues camina distinto 
voy a escaparme hasta la constelacion mas cercana la suerte es mi oxigeno tus ojos son mi ventana 
quiero correr por 7 lagos en un mismo dia 
sentir encima de mis muslos el clima de tus nalgas frias 
llegar al tope de la sierra abrazarme con las nubes 
sumergirme bajo el agua y ver como las burbujas suben y

dame la mano y vamos a darle la vuelta al mundo darle la vuelta al mundo darle al vuelta al mundo 
dame la mano y vamos a darle la vuelta al mundo darle la vuelta al mundo darle al vuelta al mundo

{\bf Em                        G}
This is a song that came upon me one night 
{\bf           Am}
When the news it had been telling me 
{\bf        C                D}
About one more war and one more fight
{\bf       Em }
And 'aeh' I sighed but then
{\bf      G}
I thought about my friends
{\bf          Am}
Then I wrote this declaration
{\bf          C              D}
Just in case the world end
{\bf  }


{\bf            Verse 2:}
Our guns
{\bf Em             G}
 We shot them in the things we said
{\bf         Am}
Ah we didn't need no bullets 
{\bf          C            D}
Cos we rely on some words instead 
{\bf Em}
Kill someone in argument
{\bf G}
Outwit them with our brains 
{\bf           Am}
And we'd kill ourselves laughing
{\bf          C                D}
At the funny things we'd say 



{\bf            Verse 3:}
And bombs 
{\bf Em              G}
  We had them saved for special times
{\bf           Am}
When the crew would call a shakedown 
{\bf      C            D}
We break down a party landmine 
{\bf Em}
Women that so sexy 
{\bf         G}
They explode us with their looks 
{\bf          Am}
Ah we blowing up some speakers 
{\bf           C              D        }
Jumping round till the ground shook 



{\bf            Verse 4:}
And missiles
{\bf Em                   G}
   They were the roadtrips that we launched
{\bf        Am}
T-t-tripping across this island 
{\bf             C              D}
Starting missions at the break of dawn
{\bf  Em}
Yawn and smile say 
{\bf         G}
What direction shall we take? 
{\bf Am}
Somewhere where it warm and wet 
{\bf C                        D}
This be the route we'd always take and 



{\bf            Chorus:}
{\bf Am                      Em}
  Our weapons were our instruments 
{\bf G           D          C}
Made from timber and steel 
{\bf               Am}
We never yielded to conformity 
{\bf       Em}
But stood like kings 
{\bf         G}
In a chariot that's riding on a

Record wheel

{\bf            Em}
And our airforce flying 
{\bf             G}
When the frisbee in the sky 
{\bf          Am}
Have a session while we're smoking
{\bf              C           D}
Now we're feeling extra high 
{\bf           Em }
And we'd sneak into a carpark
{\bf             G}
With the skaties on our back 
{\bf             Am}
And we're flying down the levels howling 
{\bf          C                D}
On the attack now on the attack



{\bf            Verse 6:}
And battles 
{\bf Em                   G}
  They happened in these dancehalls 
{\bf            Am}
See we'd rather fight with music
{\bf     C               D}
Choosing one the rhythm war
{\bf Em}
Battle at these shakedowns 
{\bf          G}
And we battle at these gigs 
{\bf         Am}
We do battle in our bedrooms 
{\bf             C                D}
Made some sweet love to the beat 



           Bridge:
{\bf            Em}
Then our allies grew 
{\bf      G}
Wherever we would roam 
{\bf         Am }
See whenever we're together 
{\bf         C             D}
Any stranger feel at home 
{\bf       Em}
In a way we are an army 
{\bf           G}
But this army not destruct 
{\bf       Am}
No instead we're doing simple things
{\bf        C             D}
Good loving find it run amuck 



{\bf            Verse 7:}
{\bf Em}
This be a declaration 
{\bf    G}
Written about my friends
{\bf         Am}
It's engraved into this song 
{\bf          C               D}
So they know I'm not forgetting them 
{\bf       Em}
See maybe if the world contained
{\bf  G}
More people like these 
{\bf           Am}
Then the news would not be telling me
{\bf        C                   D}
About all that warfare endlessly and

{\bf VERSE 1: }

Oh, I had nine lives but I lost all of them

And I've been searching in the rain 
I tried to find them, but they disappeared 
They walked away, they dressed in black 
They left my side and all I say is 
That I wasted time when I looked for them 
For now I know that things gone past  
Are never to be found again 
No never, never again 
I had nine lives but lost all of them... 
{\bf  }
{\bf VERSE 2: }
I had a plan but never finished it 
And I've been searching for the thought 
And I've been searching in a haze  
I try all days, to remember it 
But now the blueprint in my mind has gone 
My mind forgot the colour of direction 
And my eyes they see the hands 
That could've built that could've constructed 
The empire in my mind 
The empire I'll never find 
I had a plan but that was where it ended....ended.....

[For this section, its really just the four chords written, but I included the bass 
notes as at the start when it is slow, those are very pronounced. But its just the chords 
with that Jewish Hora feel by alternating between the 5ths]

{\bf Fun...}
{\bf (we'll)}

{\bf [Same chords as verse 1]}

In summer the bushfires rage and rage
And rage
On such beautiful days
And we fight them with water that runs through the cracks
Water we're desperately trying to save
So I'll just live on wine and water my vines
And sleep on the wind with the fires right behind
And sing on the beaches and dance through the night
Oh we'll cry 'pass the wine, pass the wine, pass the wine'

{\bf Gm       Dm    A7   Dm}
Tomorrow is another day

Duck inside the doorway, gotta duck to eat
right now feels all right now, you and me we can't beat walking -

And a gogo, dancing girl, yes I saw her
the deejay, he say, here's Mandy for ya

She's dancing high, I move on by, the close ups can get rough
when you're walking in the wild west end . . .

{\bf   D (2)}
Got two reasons why I cry
{\bf     D (2)}
Away each lonely night,
{\bf        C (2)}
The first one's named Sweet Anne Marie,
{\bf           C (2)                        }
And she's my hearts delight.
{\bf         D (2)}
The second one is prison, baby,
{\bf           D (2)}
{\bf The sheriff's on my trail,}
{\bf       Am (2)}
And if he catches up with me,
{\bf         C                    D (4)}
I'll spend my life in jail.

Got a wife in Chino, babe,
And one in Cherokee
The first one says she's got my child,
But it don't look like me.

There must be some kind of way out of here
Said the joker to the thief
There's too much confusion
I can't get no relief
Buisness men they drink my wine
Plowmen dig my earth
None would ever compromise
Nobody of this world


No reason to get excited
The thief he kindly spoke
There are many here among us
Who feel that life is but a joke
But you and I we've been through that
And this is not our place
So let us stop talking falsely now
The hour's getting late


All along the watchtower
Princess kept the view
While all the women came and went
Barefoot servants too
Outside in the cold distance
A wildcat did growl
Two riders were approaching
And the wind began to howl


All along the watchtower
All along the watchtower
All along the watchtower

\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
{\bf Intro: C - C/B - G  -  G - G/F# - Em}


{\bf     C    C/B      G               G    G/F#      Em}
The last train is nearly due, the underground is closing soon,
{\bf     C      C/B    G               G       G/F#   Em}
And in the dark deserted station, restless in anticipation,
{\bf   C         C/B    G         G - G/F# - Em}
A man waits in the shadows.

{\bf  C        C/B  G                    G        G/F#     Em}
His restless eyes leap and scratch, at all that they can touch or catch,
{\bf     C      C/B      G              G      G/F#     Em}
And hidden deep within his pocket, safe within his silent socket,
{\bf    C       C/B      G        G - G/F# - Em}
He holds a coloured crayon.


{\bf     C        C/B      G               G        G/F#     Em}
Now from the tunnel's stony womb, the carriage rides to meet the groom,
{\bf     C     C/B      G                     G   G/F#   Em}
And opens wide and welcome doors, but he hesitates, then withdraws
{\bf  C     C/B    G         Em}
Deeper in the shadows.


{\bf         Em                         D}
And the train is gone suddenly, on wheels clicking silently
{\bf        C                 Am          Em               Am}
Like a gently tapping litany, and he holds his crayon rosary
{\bf  C             G       Em}
Tighter in his hand.


{\bf     C        C/B    G                     G     G/F#    Em}
Now from his pocket quick he flashes, the crayon on the wall he slashes,
{\bf  C    C/B     G              G      G/F#   Em}
Deep upon the advertising, a single-worded poem comprised of
{\bf  C  C/B  G      G - G/F# - Em}
Four letters.


{\bf         C         C/B      G       }
And his heart is laughing, screaming, pounding, 
{\bf     G    G/F#       Em}
The poem across the tracks rebounding,
{\bf  C       C/B    G               G         G/F#    Em}
Shadowed by the exit light, his legs take their ascending flight
{\bf    C        C/B       G        G/F#   C              G}
To seek the breast of darkness and be suckled by the night.

{\bf         Em                D6/9}
On the first part of the journey
I was lookin at all the life
There were plants and birds and rocks and things
There were sand and hills and rings

The first thing I met was a fly with a buzz
and the sky with no clouds
the heat was hot and the ground was dry
but the air was full of sound

{\bf  Chorus}

{\bf   Em9                              Dmaj9}
I've been through the desert on a horse with no name
it felt good to be out of the rain
in the desert you can remember your name
'cause there ain't no one for to give you no pain
la la la  la lalala   la la  la  la la


After two days in the desert sun
my skin began to turn red
After three days in the desert fun
I was looking at a river bed
And the story it told of a river that flowed
made me sad to think it was dead

{\bf  Chorus}

After nine days I let the horse run free
'cause the desert had turned to sea
there were plants and birds and rocks and things
there were sand and hills and rings
The ocean is a desert with it's life underground
and the perfect disguise above
Under the cities lies a heart made of ground
but the humans will give no love

They hate you if you're clever and they despise a fool
Till you're so fucking crazy you can't follow their rules
A working class hero is something to be
A working class hero is something to be

When they've tortured and scared you for twenty odd years
Then they expect you to pick a career
When you can't really function you're so full of fear
A working class hero is something to be
A working class hero is something to be

Keep you doped with religion and sex and T.V.
And you think you're so clever and classless and free
But you're still fucking peasants as far as I can see
A working class hero is something to be
A working class hero is something to be

There's room at the top they are telling you still
But first you must learn how to smile as you kill
If you want to be like the folks on the hill
A working class hero is something to be
A working class hero is something to be

If you want to be a hero well just follow me
If you want to be a hero well just follow me

London calling upon the zombies of death

But when we were talking-i saw you nodding out
London calling, see we ain't got no highs
Except for that one with the yellowy eyes

\subsection{Master Song}
\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
{\bf  G#			      Gm}
I believe that you heard your master sing 
{\bf  G#		   Gm}
when I was sick in bed. 
{\bf  G#			   Gm}
I suppose that he told you everything 
{\bf  G#			      Gm}
that I keep locked away in my head. 
{\bf  G#                   Cm}
Your master took you travelling, 
{\bf          Eb		      F}
well at least that's what you said. 
{\bf      Bb     Bb/A     Bb      Bb/A}
And now do you come back to bring 
{\bf       Eb		       D}
your prisoner wine and bread? 

{\bf  Intro x1}

You met him at some temple, where 
they take your clothes at the door. 
He was just a numberless man in a chair 
who'd just come back from the war. 
And you wrap up his tired face in your hair 
and he hands you the apple core. 
Then he touches your lips now so suddenly bare 
of all the kisses we put on some time before. 

And he gave you a German Shepherd to walk 
with a collar of leather and nails, 
and he never once made you explain or talk 
about all of the little details, 
such as who had a word and who had a rock, 
and who had you through the mails. 
Now your love is a secret all over the block, 
and it never stops not even when your master fails. 

And he took you up in his aeroplane, 
which he flew without any hands, 
and you cruised above the ribbons of rain 
that drove the crowd from the stands. 
Then he killed the lights in a lonely Lane 
and, an ape with angel glands, 
erased the final wisps of pain 
with the music of rubber bands. 

And now I hear your master sing, 
you kneel for him to come. 
His body is a golden string 
that your body is hanging from. 
His body is a golden string, 
my body has grown numb. 
Oh now you hear your master sing, 
your shirt is all undone. 

And will you kneel beside this bed 
that we polished so long ago, 
before your master chose instead 
to make my bed of snow? 
Your eyes are wild and your knuckles are red 
and you're speaking far too low. 
No I can't make out what your master said 
before he made you go. 

Then I think you're playing far too rough 
for a lady who's been to the moon; 
I've lain by this window long enough 
to get used to an empty room. 
And your love is some dust in an old man's cough 
who is tapping his foot to a tune, 
and your thighs are a ruin, you want too much, 
let's say you came back some time too soon. 

I loved your master perfectly 
I taught him all that he knew. 
He was starving in some deep mystery 
like a man who is sure what is true. 
And I sent you to him with my guarantee 
I could teach him something new, 
and I taught him how you would long for me 
no matter what he said no matter what you'd do. 

I believe that you heard your master sing 
while I was sick in bed, 
I'm sure that he told you everything 
I must keep locked away in my head. 
Your master took you travelling, 
well at least that's what you said, 
And now do you come back to bring 
your prisoner wine and bread?

{\bf            E}
Then she gets you on her wavelength
{\bf           F#m                                 E}
And she lets the river answer that you've always been her lover

{\bf           G#m}
And you want to travel with her
{\bf           A}
And you want to travel blind
{\bf            E}
And you know that she will trust you
{\bf               F#m                               E}
For you've touched her perfect body with your mind 

And Jesus was a sailor when He walked upon the water 
And He spent a long time watching from his lonely wooden tower
And when He knew for certain only drowning men could see Him 
He said, "All men will be sailors then until the sea shall free them"
But He Himself was broken long before the sky would open
Forsaken, almost human, He sank beneath your wisdom like a stone 

And you want to travel with him
And you want to travel blind
And you think maybe you'll trust him
For he's touched your perfect body with his mind 

Suzanne takes your hand, and she leads you to the river   
She is wearing rags and feathers from Salvation Army counters
And the sun pours down like honey on our lady of the harbor 
And she shows you where to look among the garbage and the flowers
There are heroes in the seaweed, there are children in the morning    
They are leaning out for love and they will lean that way forever   
while Suzanne holds the mirror 

And you want to travel with her
And you want to travel blind
And you know that you will trust her
For she's touched your perfect body with her mind

Her hair the black that black can go
{\bf       Am           F}
Are you a teacher of the heart?
{\bf   Am}
Soft she answered no

I met a girl across the sea
Her hair the gold that gold can be
Are you a teacher of the heart?
Yes, but not for thee

I met a man who lost his mind
In some lost place I had to find
Follow me the wise man said
But he walked behind

I walked into a hospital
Where none was sick and none was well
When at night the nurses left
I could not walk at all

Morning came and then came noon
Dinner time a scalpel blade
Lay beside my silver spoon

Some girls wander by mistake
Into the mess that scalpels make
Are you the teachers of my heart?
We teach old hearts to break

One morning I woke up alone
The hospital and the nurses gone
Have I carved enough my Lord?
Child, you are a bone

{\bf  I ate and ate and ate}
No I did not miss a plate, well
How much do these suppers cost?
We'll take it out in hate

I spent my hatred everyplace
On every work on every face
Someone gave me wishes
And I wished for an embrace

Several girls embraced me
Then I was embraced by men
Is my passion perfect?
No, do it once again

I was handsome, I was strong
I knew the words of every song
Did my singing please you?
No, the words you sang were wrong

Who is it whom I address
Who takes down what I confess?
Are you the teachers of my heart?
We teach old hearts to rest

Oh teachers are my lessons done?
I cannot do another one
They laughed and laughed and said, Well child
Are your lessons done?
Are your lessons done?
Are your lessons done?

Wait in this place where the shadows run from themselves.


You said no strings could secure you at the stations.
Platform ticket, restless diesels, goodbye windows.
I walked into such a sad time at the station.
As I walked out felt my own need just beginning.
I'll wait in the queue when the trains come back
I'll wait for you where the shadows run from themselves


At the party she was kindness in the hard crowd
Consolation from the old wound now forgotten
Yellow tigers crouched in jungles in her dark eyes
She's jst dressing goodbye windows, tired starlings
I'll sleep in this place with the lonely crowd,
Lie in the dark where the shadows run from themselves

{\bf  C                  F}
Here comes the story of the Hurricane,
{\bf  C                 F}
The man the authorities came to blame
{\bf  Dm                   C}
for something that he never done

Put in a prison cell but one time
{\bf  Em            Am   F            C   G  Am  F  Am  F}
he could have been the champion of the world

{\bf   }
Three bodied lying there does Patty see
and another man named Bello moving mysteriously
"I didn't do it" he says, and he throws up his hands
"I was only robbin the register, I hope you understand
I saw them leavin," he says and he stops
One of us had better call the cops
so Patty calls the cops
and they arrive on the scene with their red lights flashin
in the hot New Jersey night

Meanwhile somewhere in another part of town
Rubin Carter and a couple of friends are driving around
number one contender for the middleweight crown
had no idea what kind of shit was about to go down
when a cop pulled him over on the side of the road
just like the time before and the time before that
in Paterson that just the ways things go
If you black you might as well not show up on the streets
Less you wanna draw the heat

Alfred Bello had a partner and he had a rap for the cops
Him and Arthur Dexter Bradley were just out prowlin around
He said "I saw two men runnin out, they looked like middleweights
They jumped into a white car with out of state plates"
And Miss Patty Valentine just nodded her head
Cop said "Wait a minute boys, this one's not dead"
so they took him to the infirmary
and although this man could hardly see
they told him that he could identify the guilty men

Four in the morning and they haul Rubin in
Take him to the hospital and bring him upstairs
the wounded man looks up though his one dying eye
says "why'd you bring him here for? he ain't the guy!"
Yes, here the story of the Hurricane
The man the authorities came to blame
for something that he never done
put in a prison cell but one time he could've been
the champion of the world

Four months later the ghetto's in flame
Rubin's in South America fightin for his name
while Arthur Dexter Bradley's still in the robbery game
and the cops are puttin the screw to him looking for somebody to blame
"Remember that murder that happened in a bar?"
"Remember you said you saw the getaway car?"
"You think you'd like to play ball with the law?"
"Think it might have been that fighter that you saw running that night?"
"Don't forget that you are white"

Arthur Dexter Bradley said "I'm really not sure"
Cops said "A poor boy like you could really use a break
We got you for the motel job and were talking to your friend Bello
Now you don't want to ave to go back to jail, be a nice fellow
You'll be doin' society a favor
That son of a bitch is brave and getting braver
We want to put his ass in the stir
We want to pin this trip murder on him
He ain't ne Gentleman Jim"

Rubin could take a man out with just one punch
he never did like to talk about it all that much
It's my work he'd say, I do it for pay
and when it's over I'd just as soon go on my way
up to some paradise
where the trout streams flow and the air is nice
and ride a horse along a trail
but then they took him to the jail house
where they try to make a man into a mouse

All of Rubin's card were marked in advance
The trial was a pig-circus, he never had a chance
the judge made Rubin's witnesses drunkards from the slums
to the white folks who watched he was a revolutionary bum
but to the black folks he was a crazy nigger
no one doubted that he pulled the trigger

Once upon a time you dressed so fine

You threw the bums a dime in your prime, didn't you?

  People'd call, say, "Beware doll,

 He's not selling any  alibis

You never understood that it ain't no good

You shouldn't let other people get your   kicks for you

{\bf  F                                                G}
  You used to ride on the chrome horse with your   diplomat
{\bf  F                               G}
  Who carried on his shoulder a   Siamese cat

{\bf  F             Em           Dm       C}
 Ain't it hard when you discover that
{\bf  F          Em     Dm          C}
 He really wasn't where it's at
{\bf  F                                C         G}

Aww, Princess on the steeple and all the pretty people
{\bf              F                            G}
They're all drinkin', thinkin' that they   got it made
{\bf  C                Dm           Em}
 Exchanging all precious gifts
{\bf                   F                      G}
But you'd better take your diamond ring,  you'd better pawn it babe

{\bf  F               G}
  You used to be so amused
{\bf  F                    G}
  At Napoleon in rags and the language that he used

{\bf  F                  Em             Dm          C}
 Go to him now, he calls you, you can't refuse
{\bf  F             Em              Dm             C}
 When you got nothing, you got nothing to lose
{\bf  F                                        C      G}
 You're invisible now, you got no secrets to conceal.

Without ideals or violence,

Yet she's true, like ice, like fire.

She knows too much to argue or to judge.


{\bf      C                            G  F}
The bridge at midnight trembles,
{\bf                     C        G  F}
The country doctor rambles,

Bankers' nieces seek perfection,

I have no one to meet,

And the ancient empty street's too dead for dreaming.

{\bf  (chorus)}

Take me on a trip upon your magic swirling ship.
My senses have been stripped,
May hands can't feel to grip,
My toes too numb to step,
Wait only for my bootheels to be wandering.
I'm ready to go anywhere, I'm ready for to fade,
Into my own parade.
Cast your dancing spell my way, I promise to go under it.

{\bf  (chorus)}

Though you might hear laughing, spinning, swinging madly across the sun,
It's not aimed at anyone,
It's just escaping on the run,
And but for the sky there are no fences facing.
And if you hear vague traces of skipping reels of rhyme,
To your tambourine in time.
It's just a ragged clown behind,
I wouldn't pay it any mind,
It's just a shadow you're seeing that he's chasing.

{\bf  (chorus)}

Take me disappearing through the smoke rings of my mind.
Down the foggy ruins of time,
far past the frozen leaves,
The haunted frightened trees,
Out to the windy bench,
Far from the twisted reach of crazy sorrow.
Yes to dance beneath the diamond sky with one hand waving free,
Silhouetted by the sea,
Circled deep beneath the waves,
Let me forget about today until tomorrow.

And don't criticize what you don't understand
Your sons and your daughters are beyond your command
Your old road is rapidly agin'
Please get out of the new one if you can't lend a hand
For the times they are a-changin'

Come senators, congressmen please heed the call
Don't stand in the doorway, don't block up the hall
For he that gets hurt will be he who has stalled
There's a battle outside and it's ragin'
It'll soon shake your windows and rattle your walls
For the times they are a-changin'

The line it is drawn the curse it is cast
The slow one now will later be fast
As the present now will later be past
The order is rapidly fadin'
And the first one now will later be last
For the times they are a-changin'

{\bf  CAPO 2  }


{\bf  VERSE:}
{\bf           Am                         E7}
On a dark desert highway, cool wind in my hair
{\bf     G                         D               }
Warm smell of colitas rising up through the air
{\bf    F                        C}
Up ahead in the distance, I saw a shimmering light
{\bf  Dm}
My head grew heavy and my sight grew dim
{\bf  E}
I had to stop for the night


{\bf  Am                                 E7       }
There she stood in the doorway;  I heard the mission bell
{\bf  G                                     }
And I was thinking to myself 
{\bf                D}
This could be heaven or this could be hell
{\bf  F                         C}
Then she lit up a candle, and she showed me the way
{\bf  Dm}
There were voices down the corridor, 
{\bf  E}
I thought I heard them say...


{\bf  CHORUS:}

{\bf  F                         C}
 Welcome to the Hotel California.
{\bf  E7                   Am}
Such a lovely place, such a lovely face
{\bf  F                                      C}
There's Plenty of room at the Hotel California
{\bf       Dm                          E}
Anytime of year,(anytime of year) You can find us here...

{\bf  VERSE:}

Her mind is Tiffany twisted, She got a mercedes benz
She got alot of pretty pretty boys that she calls friends
How they danced in the court yard sweet summer sweat
Some dance to remember some dance to forget


So I called up the captain; Please bring me my wine (he said)
We haven't had that spirit here since 1969
and still those voice are calling from far away
Wake you up in the middle of the night 
Just to hear them say


{\bf  CHORUS:}

{\bf  F                         C}
 Welcome to the Hotel California.
{\bf  E7                   Am}
Such a lovely place, such a lovely face
{\bf  F                                      C}
There's Plenty of room at the Hotel California
{\bf       Dm                          E}
Anytime of year,(anytime of year) You can find us here...

{\bf   }
{\bf  VERSE:}
{\bf   }
Mirrors on the ceiling; the pink champagne on ice (an she said)
We are all just prisoners here , of our own device
and in the master's chambers, They gathered for the feast
They stab it with their steely knives but they
just can't kill the beast


Last thing I remember, I was running for the door
I had find the passage back to the place I was before 
"Relax" said the night man; we are programmed to receive
You can check out anytime you like
But you can never leave...  

{\bf  CHORUS 2: }

{\bf  F                         C}
 Welcome to the Hotel California.
{\bf  E7                   Am}

He sees the winding ocean drive
And everything was made for you and me
All of it was made for you and me
'Cause it just belongs to you and me
So let's take a ride and see what's mine
Singing la la la la.. lala la la [x3]

Fever! In the morning, fever all through the night


{\bf  Am         C               Dm                 Am}
Sun lights up the daytime, moon lights up the night
{\bf  Am                  C                     E                        Am }
I light up when you call my name, and you know I'm gonna treat you right
{\bf              Am     C                 Dm                     Am}
You give me fever, when you kiss me, fever when you hold me tight
{\bf  Am     C               E                     Am}
Fever! In the morning, fever all through the night


Everybody's got the fever, that is something you all know
Fever isn't such a new thing, fever started long ago


Romeo loved Juliet, Juliet she felt the same
When he put his arms around her, he said, "Julie, Baby, you're my flame”
"Thou giveth fever, when we kisseth, fever with thy flaming youth
“Fever! I'm afire, fever, yeah, I burn, forsooth.”


Captain Smith and Pocahontas had a very mad affair
When her daddy tried to kill him, she said, “Daddy, oh, don't you dare!”
"He gives me fever with his kisses, fever when he holds me tight
Fever! I'm his misses, so Daddy, Won't you treat him right?”


Now you've listened to my story, here's the point that I have made
Chicks were born to give you fever, be it Fahrenheit or Centigrade
They give you fever, when you kiss them, fever if you live and learn
Fever! 'till you sizzle, what a lovely way to burn

{\bf  E                    Am}
what a lovely way to burn
{\bf  E                    Am}
what a lovely way to burn
{\bf  E                    Am}
what a lovely way to burn

Con una taglia sulla testa tra i villagi sono andato
Molte case si sono aperte, molte volte si è ricordato
Della leggenda da Paddy Garcia, di chi non smette di sognare
Nell'utopia della rivolta e non è stanco di lottare
Per chi si unito c'è la vittoria o il plotone d'esecuzione
Eppure siamo ancora qui a gridare al mondo
"Viva la rivoluzione!"

        Esta noche por la calle suena mi tambor

Ora puoi chiamarmi Aureliano, Don Chisciotte o Pancho Villa
Ma sono un fuoco ancora acceso, sono l'urlo della gueriglia
Non combatto i mulini a vento e il nemico è sul mio sentiero
Stasera offro un ballo davanti al mondo intero
Le campane danno il segnale, tutt'intorno c'è confusione
Adesso posso urlare al mondo "Per sempre che
Viva la rivoluzione!"

{\bf  STRUM: re sol la}


L'orchestra suonava "The blackbird" nel bar sulla strada del porto, 
i pescatori gridavano forte fra il vino, la birra e le carte. 
Raccontavi le storie di viaggi, di strade, di amici caduti, 
di amori incontrati lontano e di amori che il tempo ha perduto. 


{\bf         re                    sol               si-}

{\bf  STRUM: re sol si- re sol la re}


Seduti fra pietre e brughiere guardavamo i gabbiani volare 
Raccontavi la storia del bimbo che un giorno scappò con le fate 
Ma il vento dell'ovest chamava ed il cielo d'Irlanda svaniva, 
mi svegliai in una stanza deserta ubriaco mentre il sogno finiva. 


E i giorni che passano sono lunghi e coperti di nero 
mi trascino perduto nei vicoli a maledire una terra straniera 
E i giorni son secoli aspettando di poter tornare 
di nuovo la fine del mondo cullato dal canto del mare.

hai il passo pesante di un vecchio ubriacone
ti chiudi a sognare nelle notti d’inverno
e ti copri di rosso e fiorisci d’estate.
I tuoi esuli parlano lingue straniere
si addormentano soli sognando i tuoi cieli
si ritrovano persi in paesi lontani
a cantare una terra di profughi e santi.

E in un giorno di pioggia che ti ho conosciuta,
il vento dell’ovest rideva gentile
e in un giorno di pioggia ho imparato ad amarti
mi hai preso per mano portandomi via.

E in un giorno di pioggia ti rivedrò ancora
e potrò consolare i tuoi occhi bagnati.
In un giorno di pioggia saremo vicini,
balleremo leggeri sull’aria di un Reel.

Ho massacrato Borsellini e tutti gli altri 
Ho protetto trafficanti e figli di puttana 
E ho comprato voti a colpi di lupara

Di essere ridotta ad uno straccio 
Questo male irreversibile mi ha tutta divorata 
È un male da garofanoe da scudo crociato

Fra i turisti stranieri e le grida dei galli
Nel mercato di Santa Maria

Lalalalala il cielo ha portato Remedios la bella
Lalalalala il cielo l'ha presa e l'ha portata qui

Un raggio di luce ha accecato il Caribe
E Remedios la bella è volata
Col vestito di stracci gonfiato dal vento
E una pioggia di farfalle dorate
E la gente guardava il buco nel cielo
Mentre donna Esperanza pregava
"Non è posto per gli angeli un banco di spezie
Nel mercato di Santa Maria"

Lalalalala il cielo ha portato Remedios la bella
Lalalalala il cielo l'ha presa e l'ha portata qui

Hello (hello-hello) Is there anybody in there?

Just nod if you can hear me
{\bf             Bm}
Is there anyone home

Come on (come on come on) I hear you're feeling down
{\bf  G         G/F#  Em}
I can ease your pain
{\bf               Bm}
And get you on your feet again
{\bf                                         A}
Relax (relax relax) I need some information first
{\bf  G        G/F#   Em}
Just the basic facts
{\bf           Bm}
Can you show me where it hurts

{\bf  Chorus:}

{\bf  D                          A}
There is no pain. You are receding
{\bf  D                             A}
A distant ship.  Smoke on the horizon.
{\bf  C                               G}
You are only coming through in waves
{\bf        C                                      G}
Your lips move but I can't hear what you're saying.
{\bf  D                            A}
When I was a child, I had a fever
{\bf  D                             A}
My hands felt just like two balloons
{\bf  C                               G}
Now I've got that feeling once again
{\bf                         C}
I cannot put my finger on it now
{\bf                             G}
The child is grown.  The dream is gone.
A  B-note not chord C
I --         Have become comfortably numb.

Hey there Delilah, What’s it like in New York City? 
{\bf        D                               F#m}
I’m a thousand miles away, But girl tonight you look so pretty, 
{\bf          Bm  G                 A                  Bm}
Yes you do, Time Square can’t shine as bright as you,

I swear it’s true.

Close your eyes, Listen to my voice it’s my disguise,

I’m by your side.

Hey there Delilah, I know times are getting hard, 
{\bf             D                                    F#m}

{\bf     D                                     Bm}
We know that none of them have felt this way, 
{\bf  G                               A            }
Delilah I can promise you, That by the time that we get through, 
{\bf      Bm                                               A}
The world will never ever be the same, And you’re to blame. 

{\bf  VERSE 3}
{\bf  D                        F#m}
Hey there Delilah you be good, And don’t you miss me,

Two more years and you’ll be done with school, And I'll be making history, 
{\bf  Bm        G                 A              Bm}
Like I do, You’ll know it's all because of you, 
{\bf  G             A            Bm}
We can do whatever we want to, 
{\bf  G           A               Bm                  A}
Hey there Delilah here's to you, This one’s for you. 

{\bf  FINAL CHORUS}
{\bf  D                      Bm  D                      Bm}
Oh it’s what you do to me, Oh it’s what you do to me,

A winter's day, in a deep and dark december;
{\bf  Am D7  C   G Am            Bm     Am               Bm}
I am alone, gazing from my window to the streets below
{\bf       Am             C                D}
On a freshly fallen silent shroud of snow.
{\bf  C      G     C       D7 G}
I Am A Rock, I am an island.


{\bf             G        C                 G}
I've built walls, a fortress deep and mighty,
{\bf      Am D7     C   G        Am              Bm}
That none may penetrate. I have no need of friendship;
{\bf  Am                Bm         Am                C           D}
Friendship causes pain. It's laughter and it's loving I disdain.
{\bf  C      G     C       D7 G}
I Am A Rock, I am an island.


{\bf                G              C                 G}
Don't talk of love, but I've heard the words before;
{\bf       Am       D7    C   G     Am                Bm         Am}
It's sleeping in my memory. I won't disturb the slumber of feelings
{\bf            Bm         Am            C                D}
That have died. If I never loved I never would have cried.
{\bf  C      G     C       D7 G}
I Am A Rock, I am an island.


{\bf            G             C            G}
I have my books, and my poetry to protect me;
{\bf       Am   D7     C    G    Am           Bm    Am             Bm}
I am shielded in my armor, hiding in my room, save within my womb.
{\bf    Am                 C              D}
I touched no one and no one touches me.
{\bf  C      G     C       D7 G}
I Am A Rock, I am an island.


{\bf        Am   D7       G}
And a rock feels no pain;
{\bf         Am     D7    G}
And an island never cries!

I was twenty-one years when I wrote this song
{\bf      C                       F     G      C  }
I'm twenty-three now, but I won't be for long

Time hurries on
{\bf          C      G        F  G          C}
And the leaves that are green turn to brown
{\bf           Am}
And they wither with the wind
{\bf           Dm              G}
And they crumble in your hand.

Once my heart was filled with the love of a girl
I held her close, but she faded in the night
Like a poem I meant to write
And the leaves that are green turn to brown
And they wither with the wind
And they crumble in your hand.

I threw a pebble in a brook
And watched the ripples run away
And they never made a sound
And the leaves that are green turn to brown
And they wither with the wind
And they crumble in your hand.

{\bf  C      Am     G      C}
Hello, hello, hello, hello
{\bf  C        F        G        C}
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
{\bf  F                G}
That's all there is
{\bf          C      G        F  G          C}
And the leaves that are green turn to brown.

I hear the drizzle of the rain

Like a memory it falls

Soft and warm continuing
{\bf  Am       |Em   |D       |G     C|G  |  C|G  |}
Tapping on my roof and walls.

{\bf  G |C||G|| }
And from the shelter of my mind
{\bf  Am |Em |C |Bm7| |}
Through the window of my eyes
{\bf  G |Bm|G |C||}
I gaze beyond the rain-drenched streets 
{\bf  Am|Em |D |G C|G|C|G|}
To England where my heart lies.

{\bf  G |C||G|| }
My mind's distracted and diffused
{\bf  Am|Em |C |Bm7| | }
My thoughts are many miles away
{\bf  G |Bm |G |C|| }
They lie with you when you're asleep
{\bf  Am |Em |D |G C|G|C|G| }
And kiss you when you start your day.

{\bf  |G |C||G|| }
And a song I was writing is left undone
{\bf  Am |Em |C |Bm7| | }
I don't know why I spend my time
{\bf  G |Bm |G |C ||}
Writing songs I can't believe
{\bf  Am               |Em      |D        |G   C|G  |  C|G  |}
With words that tear and strain to rhyme.


{\bf  |G |C | |G|| }
And so you see I have come to doubt
{\bf  Am        |Em    |C      |Bm7 |   |}
All that I once held as true
G |Bm |G|C|| I stand alone without beliefs
{\bf  Am        |Em     |D      |G   C|G  |  C|G  |}
The only truth I know is you.


{\bf  |G |C | |G|| }
And as I watch the drops of rain
{\bf  Am |Em |C |Bm7| | }
Weave their weary paths and die
{\bf  G           |Bm  |G       |C   |  |}
I know that I am like the rain
{\bf  Am                 |Em      |D     |G  C|G  |  C|G  |}
There but for the grace of you go I.

In restless dreams I walked alone

Narrow streets of cobblestone,

Ten thousand people, maybe more.

Take my arms that I might reach you.

But my words like silent raindrops fell,

And echoed
{\bf         G        Am}
In the wells of silence


{\bf                           G}
And the people bowed and prayed

To the neon God they made.
{\bf                           F       C}
And the sign flashed out it's warning,
{\bf                        F     C}
In the words that it was forming.
{\bf                         F}
And the sign said, the words of the prophets


{\bf      Am                    C}
Are written on the subway walls

                                      *wfill2*
A scene badly written in which I must play.
And I know as I gaze at my young love beside me,
The morning is just a few hours away.

Non è detto che fossimo santi,
L'eroismo non è sovraumano,
Corri, abbassati, dài, balza avanti,
Ogni passo che fai non è vano.

Vedevamo a portata di mano,
Dietro il tronco, il cespuglio, il canneto,
L'avvenire d'un mondo più umano
E più giusto, più libero e lieto.

Ormai tutti han famiglia, hanno figli,
Che non sanno la istoria di ieri.
Io son solo e passeggio tra i tigli
Con te, cara, che allora non c'eri.

E vorrei che quei nostri pensieri,
Quelle nostre speranze d'allora,
Rivivessero in quel che tu speri,
O ragazza color dell'aurora.

Avevamo vent'anni e oltre il ponte
Oltre il ponte che è in mano nemica
Vedevam l'altra riva, la vita,
Tutto il bene del mondo oltre il ponte.

Tutto il male avevamo di fronte,
Tutto il bene avevamo nel cuore,
A vent'anni la vita è oltre il ponte,
Oltre il fuoco comincia l'amore.

{\bf            Verse 1:}
{\bf Em                        G}
This is a song that came upon me one night 
{\bf           Am}
When the news it had been telling me 
{\bf        C                D}
About one more war and one more fight
{\bf       Em }
And 'aeh' I sighed but then
{\bf      G}
I thought about my friends
{\bf          Am}
Then I wrote this declaration
{\bf          C              D}
Just in case the world end
{\bf  }


{\bf            Verse 2:}
Our guns
{\bf Em             G}
 We shot them in the things we said
{\bf         Am}
Ah we didn't need no bullets 
{\bf          C            D}
Cos we rely on some words instead 
{\bf Em}
Kill someone in argument
{\bf G}
Outwit them with our brains 
{\bf           Am}
And we'd kill ourselves laughing
{\bf          C                D}
At the funny things we'd say 



{\bf            Verse 3:}
And bombs 
{\bf Em              G}
  We had them saved for special times
{\bf           Am}
When the crew would call a shakedown 
{\bf      C            D}
We break down a party landmine 
{\bf Em}
Women that so sexy 
{\bf         G}
They explode us with their looks 
{\bf          Am}
Ah we blowing up some speakers 
{\bf           C              D        }
Jumping round till the ground shook 



{\bf            Verse 4:}
And missiles
{\bf Em                   G}
   They were the roadtrips that we launched
{\bf        Am}
T-t-tripping across this island 
{\bf             C              D}
Starting missions at the break of dawn
{\bf  Em}
Yawn and smile say 
{\bf         G}
What direction shall we take? 
{\bf Am}
Somewhere where it warm and wet 
{\bf C                        D}
This be the route we'd always take and 



{\bf            Chorus:}
{\bf Am                      Em}
  Our weapons were our instruments 
{\bf G           D          C}
Made from timber and steel 
{\bf               Am}
We never yielded to conformity 
{\bf       Em}
But stood like kings 
{\bf         G}
In a chariot that's riding on a 
{\bf    D}
Record wheel 

{\bf             Verse 5:}
{\bf            Em}
And our airforce flying 
{\bf             G}
When the frisbee in the sky 
{\bf          Am}
Have a session while we're smoking
{\bf              C           D}
Now we're feeling extra high 
{\bf           Em }
And we'd sneak into a carpark
{\bf             G}
With the skaties on our back 
{\bf             Am}
And we're flying down the levels howling 
{\bf          C                D}
On the attack now on the attack



{\bf            Verse 6:}
And battles 
{\bf Em                   G}
  They happened in these dancehalls 
{\bf            Am}
See we'd rather fight with music
{\bf     C               D}
Choosing one the rhythm war
{\bf Em}
Battle at these shakedowns 
{\bf          G}
And we battle at these gigs 
{\bf         Am}
We do battle in our bedrooms 
{\bf             C                D}
Made some sweet love to the beat 



           Bridge:
{\bf            Em}
Then our allies grew 
{\bf      G}
Wherever we would roam 
{\bf         Am }
See whenever we're together 
{\bf         C             D}
Any stranger feel at home 
{\bf       Em}
In a way we are an army 
{\bf           G}
But this army not destruct 
{\bf       Am}
No instead we're doing simple things
{\bf        C             D}
Good loving find it run amuck 



{\bf            Verse 7:}
{\bf Em}
This be a declaration 
{\bf    G}
Written about my friends
{\bf         Am}
It's engraved into this song 
{\bf          C               D}
So they know I'm not forgetting them 
{\bf       Em}
See maybe if the world contained
{\bf  G}
More people like these 
{\bf           Am}
Then the news would not be telling me
{\bf        C                   D}
About all that warfare endlessly and

{\bf  }
the words go a little like this... 
{\bf  }
{\bf VERSE 1: }
{\bf     Dm                                        Bb }
Oh, I had nine lives but I lost all of them 
{\bf               F }
And I've been searching in the night  
{\bf                          Am7 (and so on)...       }
And I've been searching in the rain 
I tried to find them, but they disappeared 
They walked away, they dressed in black 
They left my side and all I say is 
That I wasted time when I looked for them 
For now I know that things gone past  
Are never to be found again 
No never, never again 
I had nine lives but lost all of them... 
{\bf  }
{\bf VERSE 2: }
I had a plan but never finished it 
And I've been searching for the thought 
And I've been searching in a haze  
I try all days, to remember it 
But now the blueprint in my mind has gone 
My mind forgot the colour of direction 
And my eyes they see the hands 
That could've built that could've constructed 
The empire in my mind 
The empire I'll never find 
I had a plan but that was where it ended....ended.....

Depending on what version you have, various sections get repeated...
I'm sure you can work it out.

The songs that we sung when the dark days come

Are the songs that we sung when we chased them away

If I ever found a pot of gold

I'd buy bottles untold of the nectar of the vines

In summer the bushfires rage and rage
And rage
On such beautiful days
And we fight them with water that runs through the cracks
Water we're desperately trying to save
So I'll just live on wine and water my vines
And sleep on the wind with the fires right behind
And sing on the beaches and dance through the night
Oh we'll cry 'pass the wine, pass the wine, pass the wine'

{\bf Gm       Dm    A7   Dm}
Tomorrow is another day

Drink...

tricky part is the melody line, which I wont include, but if anyone actually wants it just 
contact me]

{\bf Gm        F      C    F}

We're heading down to Half Moon Bay

	Walking with your wild best friend


And my conductress on the number nineteen, she was a honey
pink toenails and hands all dirty with the money
greasy greasy greasy hair, easy smile
made me feel nineteen, for awhile
and I went down to Chinatown
in the backroom it's a man's world, all the money go down
Duck inside the doorway, gotta duck to eat
right now feels all right now, you and me we can't beat walking -

{\bf Chorus}

And a gogo, dancing girl, yes I saw her
the deejay, he say, here's Mandy for ya
I fell all right to see her, but she's paid to do that stuff
She's dancing high, I move on by, the close ups can get rough
when you're walking in the wild west end . . .

Il paese era molto giovane i soldati a cavallo erano la sua difesa
il verde brillante della prateria dimostrava lampante l'esistenza di Dio
del Dio che progetta la frontiera e costruisce la ferrovia
{\bf                          Do}
a quel tempo io ero un ragazzo 
che giocava a ramino e fischiava alle donne
{\bf Fa  Do}
    credulone e romantico con due baffi da uomo
{\bf Rem                               Sol             }
se avessi potuto scegliere tra la vita e la morte,

avrei scelto l'America.
{\bf Fa                       Do}
Tra bufalo e locomotiva, la differenza salta agli occhi
{\bf Re7 }
la locomotiva ha la strada segnata, 
{\bf Sol       Re7     Sol     Mim  Sol7 Fa}
il bufalo può scartare di lato e cadere
{\bf                    Do      Lam           Rem7           Sol7}
questo decise la sorte del bufalo, l'avvenire dei miei baffi
{\bf      Sol      Do   La7  Re}
e il mio mestiere.
{\bf                              Sol         Fa#m}
Ora ti voglio dire c'è chi uccide per rubare,

{\bf Sol       La            La7         Re   }

io uccidevo per essere il migliore

E mi ricordo infatti un pomeriggio triste

diminuzione dei cavalli aumento dell'ottimismo

I lit out from Reno,

I was trailed by twenty hounds
{\bf  G (2)}
Didn't get to sleep that night
{\bf                C (2)}
'Till the morning came around.

{\bf Chorus:}
{\bf   D (2)}
Set out runnin' but I take my time
{\bf      Am (2)}
A friend of the devil is a friend of mine
{\bf    D (2)}
If I get home before daylight,
{\bf    Am (2)                                 D (4)}
I just might get some sleep tonight.

Ran into the devil, babe,
He loaned me twenty bills
I spent the night in Utah
In a cave up in the hills.

{\bf Chorus}

I ran down to the levee
But the devil caught me there
He took my twenty-dollar bill
And vanished in the air.

{\bf Chorus}

Bridge:
{\bf   D (2)}
Got two reasons why I cry
{\bf     D (2)}
Away each lonely night,
{\bf        C (2)}
The first one's named Sweet Anne Marie,

And she's my hearts delight.
{\bf         D (2)}
The second one is prison, baby,
{\bf           D (2)}
{\bf The sheriff's on my trail,}
{\bf       Am (2)}
And if he catches up with me,
{\bf         C                    D (4)}
I'll spend my life in jail.

Got a wife in Chino, babe,
And one in Cherokee
The first one says she's got my child,
But it don't look like me.

There must be some kind of way out of here
Said the joker to the thief
There's too much confusion
I can't get no relief
Buisness men they drink my wine
Plowmen dig my earth
None would ever compromise
Nobody of this world


No reason to get excited
The thief he kindly spoke
There are many here among us
Who feel that life is but a joke
But you and I we've been through that
And this is not our place
So let us stop talking falsely now
The hour's getting late


All along the watchtower
Princess kept the view
While all the women came and went
Barefoot servants too
Outside in the cold distance
A wildcat did growl
Two riders were approaching
And the wind began to howl


All along the watchtower
All along the watchtower
All along the watchtower

{\bf     C    C/B      G               G    G/F#      Em}
The last train is nearly due, the underground is closing soon,
{\bf     C      C/B    G               G       G/F#   Em}
And in the dark deserted station, restless in anticipation,
{\bf   C         C/B    G         G - G/F# - Em}
A man waits in the shadows.

{\bf  C        C/B  G                    G        G/F#     Em}
His restless eyes leap and scratch, at all that they can touch or catch,
{\bf     C      C/B      G              G      G/F#     Em}
And hidden deep within his pocket, safe within his silent socket,
{\bf    C       C/B      G        G - G/F# - Em}
He holds a coloured crayon.


{\bf     C        C/B      G               G        G/F#     Em}
Now from the tunnel's stony womb, the carriage rides to meet the groom,
{\bf     C     C/B      G                     G   G/F#   Em}
And opens wide and welcome doors, but he hesitates, then withdraws
{\bf  C     C/B    G         Em}
Deeper in the shadows.


{\bf         Em                         D}
And the train is gone suddenly, on wheels clicking silently
{\bf        C                 Am          Em               Am}
Like a gently tapping litany, and he holds his crayon rosary
{\bf  C             G       Em}
Tighter in his hand.


{\bf     C        C/B    G                     G     G/F#    Em}
Now from his pocket quick he flashes, the crayon on the wall he slashes,
{\bf  C    C/B     G              G      G/F#   Em}
Deep upon the advertising, a single-worded poem comprised of
{\bf  C  C/B  G      G - G/F# - Em}
Four letters.


{\bf         C         C/B      G       }
And his heart is laughing, screaming, pounding, 
{\bf     G    G/F#       Em}
The poem across the tracks rebounding,
{\bf  C       C/B    G               G         G/F#    Em}
Shadowed by the exit light, his legs take their ascending flight
{\bf    C        C/B       G        G/F#   C              G}
To seek the breast of darkness and be suckled by the night.
